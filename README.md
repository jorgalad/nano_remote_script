### Instructions
Before using the script make sure you reset your controller to the factory settings.
1. Download the remote script from the manufacturer's website.
2. Manually create a folder called “Remote Scripts” within your User Library   
The default User Library location:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  *Windows: \Users\[username]\Documents\Ableton\User Library*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Mac: Macintosh HD/Users/[username]/Music/Ableton/User Library*
3. Place the unzipped remote script into the "Remote Scripts" folder you just created.
